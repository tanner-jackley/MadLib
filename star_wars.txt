The Force is a mystical, {adjective} power. As
Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi once said,"The Force
is an energy field, created by all living 
{plural_noun}, that surrounds us, penetrates us,
and binds the {noun} together." Using the power
of the Force, a Jedi can do many {adjective}
things, like using the Force to exercise 
{body_part} control over {adjective}-minded
{plural_noun}. A Jedi can also use the Force to
move objects with his or her {body_part}. It
doesn't matter how {adjective} these objects are;
it only matters how {adverb} the Jedi belives in 
the Force. Most importantly, the Force teaches a 
Jedi to rely on his or her feelings. As Obi-Wan
Kenobi told his student, Luke {noun}-walker: "Your 
{body_part_(plural)} can deceive you. Don't trust them." Instead, 
a Jedi should {adverb} trust in the Force.
