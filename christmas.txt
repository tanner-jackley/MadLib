I am so excited for Christmas this year!
I've been doing a lot of {verb_(-ing)} to prepare!

I have already picked out presents for everyone.
I got {person} a {noun}, and {person} a {noun}.
I wrapped their presents in {noun} and hid them 
in the {room} so they wouldn't find them.

{person} and I made {food} for everyone to enjoy. 
They smell {adjective}! I can't wait to eat them!

We picked out the perfect tree. It is {adjective}, 
and {adjective} and smells like {scent}. It's my 
job to {verb} the tree every day.

I've been hoping for a {noun} under the Christmas 
tree this year. I really don't want to get a 
{noun} this year!
